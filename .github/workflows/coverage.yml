name: Test Coverage

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This workflow enforces a minimum 80% test coverage threshold.
# It runs on every push and pull request targeting master or develop.
#
# To block merges when coverage is below 80%:
#   1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Branches
#   2. Add a branch protection rule for `master` (and `develop`)
#   3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
#   4. Search for and select the status check named: "coverage"
#   5. Enable "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
